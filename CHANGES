commit 26d46e809fd6f084e2c790c3216869a257b23d99

    reset tokens when an old conn handles a new req

    If a connection is re-used by the client (likely via keep-alive), the
    previously parsed tokens by the first request are retained and present during
    the second request. This results in the tokens array containing multiple sets
    of conflicting tokens rather than the active state of the current
    request.

    Whenever `HSH_TOK_METHOD` is encountered, the tokens array size tracking
    is reset. No memory needs to be freed as the token structs are re-used
    by the library, and they do not retain any memory allocations, only
    memory views.
